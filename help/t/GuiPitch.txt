# baxx.dev is a simple backup service with unix philosophy in mind

Tackling the fundamental problems with backups:
  * anomaly detection
  * notifications
  * alerts
  * durability
  * watching the watchers

In 20 years of experience I have used many backup solutions, from one
line scripts to complicated systems, and in almost all cases when I
needed the data it was either corrupt or 0 bytes, or was missing.

## Alpha:

baxx.dev is still alpha, use at your own risk
no guarnatees about the data [yet]

## Why charging during alpha:

Because I want to see if someone really cares about this.
Lets work together to make usable backup service!

## End goal

* zero configuration notifications
  using active learning (or machine teaching as they call it now)

* ask when uncertain
  when some anomaly is detected, keep the files and wait for manual
  confirmation (via email)

* easy configuration
  easy and intuitive rules that can be shared
