## POST: https://baxx.dev/sync/sha256/$BAXX_TOKEN

This endpoint takes the multiple lines of shasum output
and returns only the lines that are not found, example input:

if you have already uploaded the file c it will return

it is very handy for rsync like uploads:
find | xargs shasum | curl diff | curl upload

example:
 find . -type f \
  | xargs -P4 -I '{}' \
    shasum -a 256 {} \
  | curl -s --data-binary @- https://baxx.dev/sync/sha256/$BAXX_TOKEN \
  | awk '{ print $2 }' \
  | xargs -P4 -I '{}' \
    curl -s -T {} https://baxx.dev/io/$BAXX_TOKEN/backup/{}

it is *VERY* important to curl to /sync/sha256 with --data-binary
otherwise curl is in ascii mode and does *not* send the new lines, and
only the first line is checked.

This is super annoying, and I am sure someone will lose backups
because of this, and there is nothing I can do about it.

This small script will find all files, then compute the shasums in
parallel check the diff with what is uploaded on baxx and upload only
the missing ones
